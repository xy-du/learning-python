# learning-python

Introduction
--------------

This project is a record of my python learning process. Each commit is a code snippet, and most of these snippets are
self-contained. Generally speaking, different branches represent different topics and the commits contained therein have
a certain continuity.

Heads-Up
--------------

* I do not consider the branches in this repo carry the meaning that branches should. You will see that they are
  basically sequential, and the reason is that I do want give different part of the development process of this repo
  some kinda tag-like things, but as time goes by, I realise that I often have to use the code from a early time, so
  totally separated branches seems not a wise choice. And I can keep merging into the master, yes, but that will be just
  simple fast forward, so I think, why bother? :) (truth be told, I am Not very good at all this branches things. yet!
  hahaha)

* Compare every commit with the one before it to see the increment made in it.

* Say, you are using pycharm. Just open the Git tab and browse all the commits. When you click a commit, the changed
  file in that commit will show, click the file you will see the changes made in that file, which is the self-contained
  code snippet.

* When you checkout to different commit and run the script, there something you need to know. In the early stage of this
  project, you can see all the output in one file. But later, I find that this makes it hard to identify the output of
  the code of this commit, so when I make some addition in a commit, I will comment all the output of earlier commits in
  the same file. And sometimes, the file will not be able to run since there are errors, this is when you should select
  certain part of the code and run them in the python console(option+shift+E in pyCharm on macOS), don't worry, when
  this is the case, there will be indications.
