# learning-python

Introduction
--------------

This project is a record of my python learning process. Each commit is a code snippet, and most of these snippets are
self-contained. Generally speaking, different branches represent different topics and the commits contained therein have
a certain continuity.

How to Review
--------------

* Compare every commit with the one before it to see the increment made in it.

* Say, you are using pycharm. Just open the Git tab and browse all the commits. When you click a commit, the changed
  file in that commit will show, click the file you will see the changes made in that file, which is the self-contained
  code snippet.

* When you checkout to different commit and run the script, there something you need to know. In the early stage of this
  project, you can see all the output in one file. But later, I find that this makes it hard to identify the output of
  the code of this commit, so when I make some addition in a commit, I will comment all the output of earlier commits in
  the same file. And sometimes, the file will not be able to run since there are errors, this is when you should select
  certain part of the code and run them in the python console(option+shift+E in pyCharm on macOS), don't worry, when
  this is the case, there will be indications.
